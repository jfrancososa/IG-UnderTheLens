SSL/TLS Handshakes: The data includes SSL/TLS handshakes, indicating secure communication sessions. This is evident from frames like Frame 108, which details a TLSv1 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Client Hello. This frame is part of setting up a secure connection using TLS 1.2.
IPv6 and TCP: The communication uses IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The source and destination IP addresses are IPv6 addresses, and TCP is the transport layer protocol used, as seen in the transmission details.
Cipher Suites: A range of cipher suites is proposed for the secure connection, including modern and secure suites like TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. This indicates an up-to-date and secure configuration.
Data Transfer Details: There's a flow of data between the source port 49608 and the destination port 443, which is the standard port for HTTPS connections. This is observed in both Frame 108 and Frame 111, indicating a two-way communication.
Server and Client Interaction: The data includes both client and server interactions in the SSL/TLS handshake process. The client hello message (Frame 108) and the server's response with the server hello message (Frame 111) are part of the TLS handshake protocol.
Secure Protocols and Extensions: The use of TLS 1.2 and the negotiation for TLS 1.3 in the server hello message indicate strong, modern security protocols. The handshake process includes several extensions like server_name, supported_groups, ec_point_formats, and application_layer_protocol_negotiation, which are typical in modern TLS communications.
Potential Clear Text Data: The capture includes several strings of data. Without additional context, it's unclear whether this data is sensitive. However, its presence in the capture suggests either application data or possible non-encrypted data leaks.
Device and Network Information: The packet capture includes MAC addresses indicating Apple and SagemcomBroadband devices, suggesting a Wi-Fi network environment.
Timestamps and Sequence Numbers: The data packets contain timestamps and sequence numbers, which are essential for understanding the timing and order of packet transmission in the network communication.
Security Considerations: The presence of the SSL/TLS handshake and the use of modern cipher suites suggest a focus on secure communication. However, the presence of potential clear text data might be a point of concern and should be investigated further.
Conclusion: The packet capture data represents a secure communication session over an IPv6 network using TLS for encryption. It shows a typical SSL/TLS handshake process with modern security practices. However, the potential clear text data might require further investigation to ensure there's no sensitive data leakage.
