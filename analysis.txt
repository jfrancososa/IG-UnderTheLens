here's an analysis of the captured network traffic from the test.pcapng file:

Your output indicates that the script is functioning and producing visualizations and printed information about the network traffic contained in your pcap file. Here are some interpretations and possible next steps based on the output you've shared:

Packet Lengths Histogram:
The histogram shows the distribution of packet sizes. The concentration of packets at the lower end could represent regular small-sized packets (like ACK packets in TCP), and the spikes at higher values could indicate data transmissions (possibly images or video content if this is Instagram traffic).
Total HTTPS Packets:
The count of HTTPS packets indicates that a significant portion of the traffic is encrypted, which is consistent with secure web and application traffic. This suggests that Instagram is using encryption to protect user data.
Payloads:
The payloads you printed are likely encrypted (as indicated by the \x17\x03\x03 sequence, which is characteristic of TLS traffic), reinforcing the conclusion that the data is being transmitted securely.
While you cannot decrypt these payloads without the proper keys, the fact that you're seeing encrypted payloads is a positive sign of Instagram's security measures.
Flow Analysis:
The flow analysis output shows communication between specific IP address pairs and the number of packets exchanged. This information can help identify the most active nodes in the network traffic and is useful for understanding communication patterns.
Based on this analysis, your conclusion that Instagram is taking measures to secure data transmission seems to be supported. The presence of encrypted packets (HTTPS on port 443) and the absence of plaintext sensitive data in the payload output are good indicators of robust security practices.

SSL/TLS Packets Analysis:
You have a total of 70 packets that are likely to be SSL/TLS, as indicated by their use of port 443. This suggests a significant portion of the traffic is encrypted, which is common for secure web communications, including those used by apps like Instagram.
Protocol Distribution:
The Counter({6: 45, 17: 16}) output shows the distribution of protocols in your capture. The number '6' represents TCP, with 45 packets, and '17' represents UDP, with 16 packets. TCP is dominant in your capture, which is typical for web and app traffic that requires reliable connection-oriented communication.
Endpoint Communication Analysis:
The list of IP address pairs shows the communication endpoints with the number of packets exchanged between them. For instance, the pair ('192.168.1.214', '224.0.0.251') with 14 packets likely represents local network traffic (multicast DNS or similar services). The other pairs, such as ('17.57.144.27', '192.168.1.129') with 11 packets, could be external servers communicating with a device on your local network (the 192.168.1.x addresses are private IP addresses).
Raw Payload Output:
The raw payloads are presented as byte strings (e.g., b'l3i\x96\x8a%...'). These are likely encrypted and thus not immediately human-readable. This encryption is consistent with the use of SSL/TLS protocols for secure data transmission.
Flow Analysis:
The flow analysis lists communication flows between source and destination IPs along with the protocol number and packet count. For example, Flow: ('17.248.211.65', '192.168.1.129', 6), Packet Count: 6 indicates a TCP flow (protocol 6) between these two IP addresses with 6 packets. These flows help in understanding the pattern of communication between different network entities.
Overall Analysis:

The captured data suggests a mix of local network and external server communications.
The presence of a considerable number of SSL/TLS packets (port 443) indicates encrypted traffic, typical of secure web and app communications.
The dominance of TCP over UDP is typical for web and app traffic where reliable, ordered delivery of packets is required.
The raw payload data is mostly encrypted, aligning with the observed SSL/TLS traffic.
Next Steps:

To further understand the nature of the traffic, especially for identifying data related to Instagram usage, you might filter and analyze specific IP addresses or domains known to be associated with Instagram.
Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic would require advanced techniques and appropriate legal and ethical considerations.
Correlating the captured data with specific user actions in the Instagram app could provide more insights into the app's data transmission behaviors.

Interpretation
If the traffic is mostly encrypted (which is likely), it's a sign that Instagram is using robust security measures to protect user data.
You can infer certain things from the metadata of the traffic (like packet sizes, timing, and flow patterns) but not the content of the communications.
The absence of unencrypted sensitive data (like plain text passwords or unencrypted images) in the capture would suggest good security practices by Instagram.

Packet Length Clustering:
This plot appears to be a scatter plot representing the results of a K-Means clustering algorithm applied to the lengths of packets. The different colors represent different clusters, which are likely intended to categorize packets by their size. The black dots likely represent the centroids of these clusters. The distribution of packet sizes into distinct clusters can indicate the presence of different types of traffic â€“ small packets might be control messages (like TCP acknowledgments), medium-sized packets could be standard data packets (such as text or small images), and larger packets might represent large data transfers (like high-resolution images or videos).
TCP Flag Distribution:
This bar chart shows the distribution of TCP flags within the captured packets. The flags represent different control messages in the TCP protocol. For example, 'PA' means a push acknowledgment, 'FPA' might mean a combination of finishing, pushing, and acknowledgment flags, 'A' stands for acknowledgment, 'FA' for finish and acknowledgment, and so on. A high frequency of 'A' flags is normal in a typical network communication as it indicates that a lot of packets are being acknowledged. The presence of other flags like 'S' (SYN) would indicate the start of new TCP connections, and 'F' (FIN) would indicate closing of TCP connections. The exact meanings of the combinations (like 'FPA' or 'SAE') would need further interpretation based on the specific context in which they were captured.
