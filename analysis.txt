here's an analysis of the captured network traffic from the test.pcapng file:

SSL/TLS Packets Analysis:
You have a total of 70 packets that are likely to be SSL/TLS, as indicated by their use of port 443. This suggests a significant portion of the traffic is encrypted, which is common for secure web communications, including those used by apps like Instagram.
Protocol Distribution:
The Counter({6: 45, 17: 16}) output shows the distribution of protocols in your capture. The number '6' represents TCP, with 45 packets, and '17' represents UDP, with 16 packets. TCP is dominant in your capture, which is typical for web and app traffic that requires reliable connection-oriented communication.
Endpoint Communication Analysis:
The list of IP address pairs shows the communication endpoints with the number of packets exchanged between them. For instance, the pair ('192.168.1.214', '224.0.0.251') with 14 packets likely represents local network traffic (multicast DNS or similar services). The other pairs, such as ('17.57.144.27', '192.168.1.129') with 11 packets, could be external servers communicating with a device on your local network (the 192.168.1.x addresses are private IP addresses).
Raw Payload Output:
The raw payloads are presented as byte strings (e.g., b'l3i\x96\x8a%...'). These are likely encrypted and thus not immediately human-readable. This encryption is consistent with the use of SSL/TLS protocols for secure data transmission.
Flow Analysis:
The flow analysis lists communication flows between source and destination IPs along with the protocol number and packet count. For example, Flow: ('17.248.211.65', '192.168.1.129', 6), Packet Count: 6 indicates a TCP flow (protocol 6) between these two IP addresses with 6 packets. These flows help in understanding the pattern of communication between different network entities.
Overall Analysis:

The captured data suggests a mix of local network and external server communications.
The presence of a considerable number of SSL/TLS packets (port 443) indicates encrypted traffic, typical of secure web and app communications.
The dominance of TCP over UDP is typical for web and app traffic where reliable, ordered delivery of packets is required.
The raw payload data is mostly encrypted, aligning with the observed SSL/TLS traffic.
Next Steps:

To further understand the nature of the traffic, especially for identifying data related to Instagram usage, you might filter and analyze specific IP addresses or domains known to be associated with Instagram.
Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic would require advanced techniques and appropriate legal and ethical considerations.
Correlating the captured data with specific user actions in the Instagram app could provide more insights into the app's data transmission behaviors.
